A simple program that replaces the main binary of the VFE G1000 driver with a patched one.

## Quickstart
Head over to the releases page, install the app, and run the patcher. More detailed instructions are available for every release.

## Inner workings
The app simply overwrites the main binary of the driver with a patched equivalent that is bundled with the patcher, that simply discards the version metadata request from the newer extplane plugin versions.
